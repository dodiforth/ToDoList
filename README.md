Kotlin Bootcamp
Learn to build a full Kotlin app from scratch in just 2 hours of lecture by Pirple.com

Teaching Style : 

•	Over the shoulder, we build the app in real time so that it’s easy to follow along.
•	Explicative, we explain what’s happening at every step along the way and what each line of code is doing.
